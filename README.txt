From year 2022 B.C. till âˆž

Need to install before launch:
                              docker
Also will be nice to install:
                              tmux
                              cbm

Launching like bash attack.sh 'put attack command from chat here' threads
               |   command   ||    arguments will be changed    || 3100 |
                                                            ((cores-1)*1000)+100
                                                            
Use ROOT to launch, not sudo, because systemctl is used inside. 
When you are using sudo it'll brake execution as soon as sudo session expires.
Find logfile at /var/log/attack.log if you need so. Tail -f will give some local lulz.

Don't be afraid to use tmux to easily leave terminal not keeping eye on it.
